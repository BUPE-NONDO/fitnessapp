## 🔄 **NEW: Incremental Development Workflow**

### ✅ **Correct Approach**
- Small, focused feature branches (2-5 days each)
- Frequent merges to `dev` branch
- Continuous integration and testing
- Faster feedback and reduced risk

### ❌ **Previous Approach (Fixed)**
- Large milestone branches
- Infrequent, risky merges
- Integration challenges
- Delayed feedback

## 🎯 Development Milestones Overview

| Milestone | Branch | Priority | Duration | Status |
