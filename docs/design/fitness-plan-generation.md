# Personalized Fitness Plan Generation

## Overview
AI-powered fitness plan generation based on user onboarding data, creating customized workout schedules, exercise selection, and progression plans.

## Plan Generation Algorithm

### Input Data Processing
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  personal: {
    age: number;
    gender: string;
    weight: number;
    height: number;
  };
  goals: {
    primary: 'lose-weight' | 'gain-muscle' | 'endurance' | 'general-fitness' | 'tone-body';
    secondary?: string[];
  };
  fitness: {
    level: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
    experience: number; // months
  };
  preferences: {
    location: ('home' | 'gym' | 'outdoor')[];
    equipment: ('none' | 'basic' | 'full')[];
    workoutTypes: string[];
  };
  schedule: {
    daysPerWeek: number;
    sessionDuration: number;
    preferredTimes: string[];
  };
  special: {
    interests: string[];
    injuries: string[];
  };
}
```

### Plan Generation Logic

#### 1. Goal-Based Exercise Selection
```
Lose Weight:
- 60% Cardio (HIIT, running, cycling)
- 30% Strength (compound movements)
- 10% Flexibility

Gain Muscle:
- 70% Strength (progressive overload)
- 20% Cardio (moderate intensity)
- 10% Flexibility

Endurance:
- 70% Cardio (varied intensities)
- 20% Strength (endurance-focused)
- 10% Flexibility

General Fitness:
- 40% Cardio
- 40% Strength
- 20% Flexibility
```

#### 2. Fitness Level Adjustments
```
Beginner:
- Lower intensity (60-70% max effort)
- Longer rest periods (60-90 seconds)
- Basic movements
- 2-3 exercises per muscle group

Intermediate:
- Moderate intensity (70-80% max effort)
- Medium rest periods (45-60 seconds)
- Compound + isolation exercises
- 3-4 exercises per muscle group

Advanced:
- High intensity (80-90% max effort)
- Shorter rest periods (30-45 seconds)
- Complex movements
- 4-5 exercises per muscle group
```

#### 3. Weekly Schedule Generation
```
2-3 Days/Week:
- Full body workouts
- Rest day between sessions
- Focus on compound movements

4-5 Days/Week:
- Upper/Lower split OR Push/Pull/Legs
- 1-2 rest days
- Mix of compound and isolation

6-7 Days/Week:
- Body part splits
- Active recovery days
- Varied intensity levels
```

## Generated Plan Structure

### Weekly Workout Schedule
```
Monday: Upper Body Strength
- Warm-up: 5 min dynamic stretching
- Push-ups: 3 sets x 12 reps
- Dumbbell rows: 3 sets x 10 reps
- Shoulder press: 3 sets x 8 reps
- Cool-down: 5 min stretching

Tuesday: Cardio + Core
- Warm-up: 5 min light cardio
- HIIT circuit: 20 minutes
- Core workout: 15 minutes
- Cool-down: 5 min stretching

Wednesday: Rest Day
- Optional: Light yoga or walking
- Focus on recovery and hydration

Thursday: Lower Body Strength
- Warm-up: 5 min dynamic movement
- Squats: 3 sets x 15 reps
- Lunges: 3 sets x 12 each leg
- Deadlifts: 3 sets x 10 reps
- Cool-down: 5 min stretching

Friday: Full Body Circuit
- Warm-up: 5 min
- Circuit training: 25 minutes
- Flexibility: 10 minutes

Weekend: Active Recovery
- Choose: Walking, swimming, yoga
- Duration: 30-45 minutes
```

### Intensity Levels & Progression
```
Week 1-2: Foundation (RPE 6-7)
- Focus on form and technique
- Moderate weights/intensity
- Build movement patterns

Week 3-4: Building (RPE 7-8)
- Increase weight/intensity by 5-10%
- Add complexity to movements
- Improve endurance

Week 5-6: Challenging (RPE 8-9)
- Progressive overload
- Advanced exercise variations
- Peak performance focus

Week 7-8: Recovery & Assessment
- Deload week (reduce intensity 20%)
- Reassess goals and progress
- Plan next phase
```

### Nutrition Suggestions (Optional)
```
Based on Goal: Lose Weight

Daily Calorie Target: 1,800 calories
Macronutrient Split:
- Protein: 40% (720 cal / 180g)
- Carbs: 30% (540 cal / 135g)  
- Fats: 30% (540 cal / 60g)

Meal Timing:
- Pre-workout: Light carbs + protein
- Post-workout: Protein + carbs within 30 min
- Hydration: 8-10 glasses water daily

Sample Meals:
- Breakfast: Greek yogurt with berries
- Lunch: Grilled chicken salad
- Dinner: Salmon with vegetables
- Snacks: Nuts, fruit, protein shake
```

## Technical Implementation

### Plan Generation Service
```typescript
class FitnessPlanGenerator {
  static generatePlan(userProfile: UserProfile): FitnessPlan {
    // 1. Analyze user goals and constraints
    // 2. Select appropriate exercises
    // 3. Create weekly schedule
    // 4. Set progression parameters
    // 5. Add nutrition recommendations
    // 6. Generate motivational content
  }
}
```

### Database Schema
```typescript
interface FitnessPlan {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  generatedAt: Date;
  
  overview: {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    duration: number; // weeks
    difficulty: string;
  };
  
  schedule: WeeklySchedule[];
  exercises: Exercise[];
  progression: ProgressionPlan;
  nutrition?: NutritionPlan;
  
  metadata: {
    userProfile: UserProfile;
    version: string;
    algorithm: string;
  };
}
```

## User Experience Flow
